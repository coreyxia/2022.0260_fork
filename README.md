## Code and Datasets:

1.Large Image to Small Batch
  - Code:
    -  Image_chunk_make.ipynb: The code is desigined for splitting the large images into smaller pathes to create larger training datasets.The output would be a bunch of patches with the size of 256 X 256.
  - Sample Images:
    -  cardbord/ contains 10% of the datasets used in the paper due to the limitation of the size of all files. Train folder contains image and label sub-folder with and small patches for model training. test folder contains small patches for prediction. raw data folder contains all original images. predicted folder contains the predicted images.
  - Complete dataset in google drive: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vuGQWBd6DpS9gpwWTFXdlrznNlIselyl?usp=drive_link)
2. Module: Unet 
  - Code:
    -  Unet_model.ipynb: methods for the unet model training to identify the select object with the ground truth/masks. The output would be binary object with removed background.
  - Sample Images:
    -  Woodlog/ contains 10% of the datasets used in the paper due to the limitation of the size of all files. Train folder contains image and label sub-folder with and small patches for model training. test folder contains small patches for prediction. raw data folder contains all original images. predicted folder contains the predicted images.

3. MUSIC:
  - Code:
    - MUSICCountLayers.m: used to implement the MUSIC algorithm and extract an estimate of layer counts.
    - binaryLogCount.m: provides the code to characterize and count the number of log cross-sections.
  - Images:
    - MUSIC/logbinary: woodlog predicted iamges for counting the number of log cross-sections.
    - MUSIC/cardboard: cardboard predicted images for estimating the number of layer.
4. comparison between UNET and other ML approaches:
  - Code:
    - ProcessImages.m: convert images into strips to be used for comparison between UNET and other machine learning approaches.
